# WALL-E Project Test Drivers
- Folder contains WALL-E initial peripheral drivers and files developed using the STM32F411CEU6 48pin package on the Blackpill Development board. These files were used to create and test peripherals with a similar MCU package that will be used on the WALL-E Project. The WALL-E project will use STM32F411 LQFP 64pin package, providing more pins to be used for external peripherals and any adjustments needed for the PCB.
### Peripherals
- BNO055 IMU
- MPU6050 IMU
- HC06 Bluetooth
- OV2640 Camera
- HC-SRO4 Ultrasonic Sensor
