- The goal of this assignment was to get familiar with the creating custom electronic devices leading up to the quarter project for creating custom PCB's and possible MCU chips for the project. With this assignment I created a custom STM32F411CEU6 MCU using the STM32F411xE datasheet specifying the type of chip, it's dimensions and constraits, and the pinout.
